## About

ACSS stands for Atomized CSS. ACSS relies on Atomizer to dynamically generate an Atomic stylesheet from the ACSS classes you're actually using in your project (no unused styles!), or predeclare styles in configuration - it's up to you. ACSS is not opinionated, brings no CSS of its own, and integrates nicely with your favorite task runner.
